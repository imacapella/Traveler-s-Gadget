TravelersGadget

This project from a tutorial video by Seyfeddin Başsaraç on YouTube. I got the idea and did many other things by myself by using documentation and other sources. Added all temperature measurements as input and output differently. Gagdet can cover all temperature measurements to other. And builded different kind of UI which I like softly.

Another part of project is map page. There is a map on the app with a picker which includes 3 options. Traveler

This project not designed for commercial priority. First goal is progressing my SwiftUI experinence.,
